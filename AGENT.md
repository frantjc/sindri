You are developing Sindri, a read-only container registry for pulling images built on-demand with Steamapps pre-installed on them and a Kubernetes operator that reconciles Pods and Services running containers from that container registry.

# Taking Notes

Read ./notes/*.md to refresh your memory. These are notes written by yourself in the past, for future reference. You MUST update these notes to reflect the current state of the project.

DO NOT add useless notes to ./notes/. Only record and maintain notes that a future version of yourself would benefit from reading.
